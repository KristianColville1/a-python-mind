# A Python Mind

This repository is designed with the intention of building 100 projects with the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language. I intend to document my learning through [Jupiter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

### Credits

100 python projects from [100 Days of code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/learn/lecture/2310375).
